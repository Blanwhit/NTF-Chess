**| NTF CHESS |**

**How to Play:**

NTF Chess is a chess variant adapted to be more altruistic. The rules are as follows:

**Basic Chess Rules:**

Each of the six different kinds of pieces moves differently. Pieces cannot only move through open squares (though the knight is an exception), and can never move onto a square with one of their own pieces. However, they can move onto a square with an enemy piece, and capture the enemy piece. 

**How to Move the Pieces:**

*King:*
- The king is the most important piece but is also one of the weakest. The king can only move one square in any direction - up, down, to the sides, and diagonally.
- The king may never move himself into check (where he could be captured). When the king is attacked by another piece, this is called "check". In the event of a check, the opponent is forced to get out of the check, which can be done in a variety of ways.

*Queen:*
- The queen is the most powerful piece. She can move in any one straight direction - forward, backward, sideways, or diagonally - as far as possible as long as she does not move through any of her own pieces.
- And, like with all pieces, if the queen captures an opponent's piece, her move is over.

*Rook:*
- The rook may move as far as it wants, but only forward, backward, and to the sides.

*Knight:*
- Knights move in a very different way from the other pieces – going two squares in one direction, and then one more move at a 90-degree angle, just like the shape of an “L”.
- Knights are also the only pieces that can move over other pieces.


*Bishop:*
- The bishop may move as far as it wants, but only diagonally. Each bishop starts on one color (light or dark) and must always stay on that color.

*Pawn:*
- Pawns are unusual because they move and capture in different ways: they move forward but capture diagonally. Pawns can only move forward one square at a time, except for their very first move where they can move forward two squares.
- Pawns can only capture one square diagonally in front of them. They can never move or capture backward. If there is another piece directly in front of a pawn he cannot move past or capture that piece.
- Promotion
 - Pawns have another special ability, and that is that if a pawn reaches the other side of the board, it can become any other chess piece (called promotion), excluding a king (or pawn, for that matter).
 - A pawn may be promoted to a knight, bishop, rook, or queen. A common misconception is that pawns may only be exchanged for a piece that has been captured. That is NOT true. A pawn is usually promoted to a queen. Only pawns may be promoted.
- En Passant
 - The last rule about pawns is called “en passant,” French for “in passing.” If a pawn moves out two squares on its first move and, by doing so, lands to the side of an opponent's pawn (effectively jumping past the other pawn's ability to capture it), that other pawn has the option of capturing the first pawn as it passes by.
 - This special move must be done immediately after the first pawn has moved past, otherwise the option to capture it is no longer available. Click the example below to better understand this odd but important rule.


*Castling:*
- One other special chess rule is called castling. This move allows you to do two important things all in one move: get your king to safety, and get your rook out of the corner and into the game. On a player's turn, he may move his king two squares over to one side and then move the rook from that side's corner to the right next to the king on the opposite side. However, in order to castle, the following conditions must be met:

- It must be that king's very first move
- It must be that rook's very first move
- There cannot be any pieces between the king and rook to move
- The king may not be in check or pass through check


*Checkmating:*

The purpose of the game is to checkmate the opponent's king. This happens when the king is put into check and cannot get out of check. Whichever side checkmates the other's king first wins the game. In NTF Chess, there are special rules regarding the end of the game, which will be detailed below.

**Variations due to NTF Chess:**

*Altruism Scale:*

The main difference between NTF Chess and regular chess is the altruism scale. Players can contribute to the altruism scale by sacrificing pieces and helping their opponents. If the lightning bolt on the altruism scale reaches the opponent's king, then the player will win the game.

However, players can still win through checkmate, adding a layer of complexity to the game.
